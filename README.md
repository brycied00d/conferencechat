Twilio SMS Conference Chat

Designed to be used as an SMS handler in Twilio.
Will distribute any SMS received to the rest of the distribution list,
with the sender's name prepended and a timestamp appended.
Can also send the message as a Pushover notification, and as an email.
Supports a few simple commands too; simply send your message prepended
with the command and the output will be distributed.
eg. Sending "reverse hello" --> Everyone receives "olleh"
